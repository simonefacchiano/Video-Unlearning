This repository will host the official implementation of the paper [*Human Motion Unlearning*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18674).

We introduce human motion unlearning to prevent toxic animation synthesis while preserving text-to-motion quality. We provide the first benchmark by filtering toxic samples from HumanML3D and Motion-X, and adapt image unlearning methods as baselines. We also propose *Latent Code Replacement (LCR)*, a simple, training-free method that outperforms all baselines.

*"A man does a run-up to **kick** something lying on the ground."*
